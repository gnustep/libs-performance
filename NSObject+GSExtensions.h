/* This method returns the memory usage of the receiver, excluding any
 * objects already present in the exclude table.<br />
 * The argument is a hash table configured to hold non-retained pointer
 * objects and is used to inform the receiver that its size should not
 * be counted again if it's already in the table.<br />
 * The NSObject implementation returns zero if the receiver is in the
 * table, but otherwise adds itself to the table and returns its memory
 * footprint (the sum of all of its instance variables, but not any
 * memory pointed to by those variables).<br />
 * Subclasses should override this method by calling the superclass
 * implementation, and either return the result (if it was zero) or
 * return that value plus the sizes of any memory owned by the receiver
 * (eg found by calling the same method on objects pointed to by the
 * receiver's instance variables).
