This is the initial release of the 'performance' library (version 0.1.0)


Scope
====
This library is a collection of classes intended to be used to help
improve the performance of GNUstep and Cocoa applications.  The scope
of the library is therefore -
1. Subclasses of standard Cocoa classes which are optimised for particular
uses.
2. Classes to perform tasks which can improve application performance
by mechanisms not covered by existing classes.
3. Classes to monitor/analyse performance issues so you can tell what
needs to be optimised.


Platforms
=========
GNUstep gnu/linux
GNUstep	windows/mingw32
Cocoa ... reported to work.


Contents
========
GSTicker ... functions for efficient timing where great accuracy is not
required (eg. nearest second is OK), but the overhead of getting the system
time many times per second would be a problem.  This code is used by the
GSThroughput class.

GSThroughput ... class to maintain throughput/transaction count information
to enable monitoring of application performance over long periods of time.

GSCache ... a least-recently-used cache with cahcne size limits controlled
by the number of objects in the cache or the amount of memory used by the
cache or both.  This class is used by the SQLClient library to handle
in-memory caching of information retrieved from databases.
