 * <p>The GSThroughput class is used maintain statistics about the number
 * of events or the duration of operations in your software.
 * </p>
 * <p>For performance reasons, the class avoids locking and you must ensure
 * that an instance of the class is only ever used by a single thread
 * (the one in which it was created).  You are responsible for ensuring
 * that a run loop runs in each thread in which you use an instance, so that
 * stats can be updated for that thread every second.
 * </p>
 * <p>You create an instance of the class for each event/operation that you
 * are interested in monitoring, and you call the -add: or -addDuration:
 * method to record events.<br />
 * For duration logging, you may also use the -startDuration: and
 * -endDuration methods to handle adding of the amount of time taken between
 * the two calls.
 * </p>
 * <p>To dump a record of the gathered statistics, you may call the
 * -description method of an instance or the class +description method
 * to dump statistics for all instances in the current thread.<br />
 * If you need to gather a record for all the threads you use, you must
 * generate a dump in each thread and combine the results.
 * </p>
 * <p>To be notified of statistics at the end of each minute, you may call
 * the -enableNotifications: method for an instance.  The notifications are
 * generated in the thread that instance belongs to.
