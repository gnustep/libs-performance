/**
 * The GSCache class is used to maintain a cache of objects in memory
 * for relatiovely rapid access.<br />
 * Typical usage might be to keep the results of a database query around
 * for a while in order to re-use them ... for instance when application
 * configuration is obtained from a database which might be updated while
 * the application is running.<br />
 * When the cache is full, old objects are removed to make room for new
 * ones on a least-recently-used basis.<br />
 * Cache sizes may be limited by the number of objects in the cache,
 * or by the memory used by the cache, or both.  Calculation of the
 * size of items in the cache is relatively expensive, so caches are
 * only limited by number of objects in the default case.<br />
 * Objects stored in the cache may be given a limited lifetime,
 * in which case an attempt to fetch an <em>expired</em> object
 * from the cache will cause it to be removed from the cache instead
 * (subject to control by the delegate).
